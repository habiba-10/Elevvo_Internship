# Elevvo Internship Projects

Welcome to my *Elevvo Internship Projects* repository! This repository contains all the tasks I completed during the Elevvo Internship, covering a variety of *Data Science* and *Machine Learning* projects. Each task focuses on different techniques including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

## Projects Overview

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each completed task:

ðŸ”¹ *Student Score Prediction*  
- Predict studentsâ€™ scores based on various features.  
- Techniques used: Linear Regression, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Voting Regressor.  
 

ðŸ”¹ *Customer Segmentation*  
- Cluster customers based on income and spending scores.  
- Techniques used: K-Means Clustering, Feature Scaling, EDA.  
 

ðŸ”¹ *Forest Cover Type Classification*  
- Predict the type of forest cover based on cartographic features.  
- Techniques used: Random Forest, XGBoost, Hyperparameter Tuning.    

ðŸ”¹ *Loan Approval Prediction Description*  
- Predict whether a loan will be approved based on applicant data.  
- Techniques used: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, SMOTE for imbalance handling.  
 

ðŸ”¹ *Movie Recommendations System Description*  
- Build a movie recommendation system based on user ratings.  
- Techniques used: Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization, Model Evaluation.
